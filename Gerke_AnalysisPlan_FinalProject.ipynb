    "After reviewing the feedback for my project proposal, I decided to steer away from the Goodreads API dataset I originally wanted to use. I instead thought I would use the suggested dataset: Google Books. However, after researching that, I found that Google Books is not the most consistent when it comes to categorizing books into genres nor including reviews on books. I considered using Amazon, but after realizing there are extra steps involved in retrieving the data, and the data may not be accurate anyway, I went back to Goodreads. However, I did find a different dataset that I did not see before that looks promising in how it contains both genre and reviews. But if this does not provide enough data, I think I will have no other choice than to combine and cross reference a different dataset to work with this Goodreads data."

    "- My project proposal is finding out how the genre of a book effects the amount of reviews a book genre has. I want to see if some genres have more reviews and if those reviews are considered \"good\" or 'bad\". Does historical fiction have more positive reviews than mystery? This will give me insight on which genres are most popular (most reviewed) and also if popularity really proves that a genre is \"good\". I will need to define \"good\" and \"bad\" reviews, determine which genres I will be looking at, and find the number of reviews on a specific genre. I think I am going to try to either choose to focus on five specific genres or group similar genres together into five categories. \n",

    "__My Goodreads hypothesis:__\n",
    "- The genre of a book correlates with the amount of good and bad reviews it has. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Theoretical: The popularity of a book genre proves a genre is \"good\" or has positive reviews.\n",
    "- Statistical: Specific genres will recieve a large number of reviews that are mostly positive and that will prove that a genre is \"good\" and \"popular\". While other genres will recieve less reviews in general and of those reviews, they will be mostly negative which will prove that a genre is \"bad\" and \"unpopular\".\n",
    "\n",
    "__The data that is most suitable for my hypothesis:__\n",
    "- After reviewing the feedback left on my Data in Hand checkpoint, my main focus will be using the books_df the most since it has an abundance of information that connects to my specific hypthosis/proposal. I was told to not get distracted by the ratings and to read data sets. This has solidified my choosing to focus on organizing the average ratings, ratings_count, author and title in the books_df, and figuring out a way to categorize them into genres. I will also most likely need to merge the data from the book_tags and tags data set to categorize a book's ID to a genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Reliable vs. Unreliable:__\n",
    "- This data will be reliable in the fact that it will be able to collect the actual ratings and reviews left by people and present them in an organized way. It can showcase which books have higher/more and lower/less reviews based on what is on Goodreads. \n",
    "- This data may be unreliable in a couple ways: Goodreads is not the only book review platform and therefore even if this data reads that one genre is good, another platform could determine that the same genre is actually bad; since reviews are and can be left by anyone, there is a possibility that people purposly left good or bad reviews on a book to support a specific author; and finally, people all have differing opinions, just because the reviews of a genre/book are good, it doesn't mean an individual will actually _like_ the genre/book. So this data can't actually guarantee to an individual perosn if they will think a genre is good or bad before they read a book.\n",

I can already easily see the average rating of a book, the number of total ratings, and the number of total text reviews.
