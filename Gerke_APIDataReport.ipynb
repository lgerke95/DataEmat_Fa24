    "- The danceablility of a song correlates directly with the energy and loudness of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Explain the theoretical and the statistical applications of your hypothesis.__\n",
    "- Theoretical: The louder a song is and the more energy it has, the more danceable a song is.\n",
    "- Statistical: A song scores from level 0 (lowest) to level 1 (highest). When a song scores .5 or higher on each energy _and_ loudness levels, the danceability score will indicate a song is suitable to dance to by scoring .5 or higher.\n",

    "\n",
    "__Identify and describe the Spotify API endpoints you will use to collect data. Explain why these endpoints (and which of the response objects) are suitable to test your hypothesis.__\n",
    "- I will need the \"Get Track's Audio Features\" endpoint that is under the \"Tracks\" reference to get the danceability, loudness, and energy data.\n",
    "- My hypothesis relies solely on what data presents itself with these three endpoints.\n",
    "- I will be using Billie Eilish's latest album, \"Hit Me Hard and Soft\". I think there are a variety of different types of songs and beats and overall vibes in this specific album. And hopefully this will showcase a good set of data for me to determine if my hypothesis is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Discuss the ways in which this data might be reliable and unreliable.__\n",
    "- The danceability level is determined by \"a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity\" and the data would be reliable in calculating all of that data as it would be factual. On the other hand, this data could be deemed unreliable in how it is incapable of taking human opinion into account. There is a possibility that even if a song is deemed danceable based on the calculated elemtents, a person may disagree in that the song cannot be danced to.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Are there any limitations or caveats to the response objects that might alter your ability to test your hypothesis?__\n",
    "- Yes, the data I find may be limited or nonexistent based on which song, genre, or artist I use to test and find data for."

    "___I originally had \"aud_feats_ep\" have this URL: https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-features/{}. Everything worked with it until I tried to actually isolate \"audio features\". After much trial and error of adjusting the names and definitions of things, I just could not figure out why it was giving me a 400 output. So I asked chatgpt what was wrong and it suggested I double check the \"aud_feats_ep\" url and add on \"?ids={}\" to the end of it. Sure enough, after I did that, the output changed to 200. However, when I actually went to look at the DataFrame using \".head()\", nothing I could use showed up. I knew we did this exact data frame in class so went back to the notes from 10-1-24 and saw the URL we used for audio features didnt have ANYTHING on the end of it: https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-features. So THAT is what \"fixed\" my dataframe. That's why there are commented out bits of code underneath my url definition cell.___"

    "___Overall, I felt like I was using the in-class notes very heavily to do this. But really, I only resorted to that after I attempted to do it my own way multiple different times. And through that process I felt like I got a better grasp and understanding of how this type of data works. I really wanted to forgo creating the album dataframe and that was my main struggle in this assignment, but it was also the thing that taught me the most because I had to understand that I needed to create it if I wanted my data to turn out analyzable for my hypothesis. Another idea I want to explore is converting this dataframe into some kind of chart so I can clearly see the correlation between danceability, energy, and loudness. Also, I did not realize loudness levels were in the negatives, so I might need to redefine \"loudness\" in my hypothesis and figure out it's correlation with energy and danceability (e.g. what means loud and what means quieter, and do I intend to mean if it's louder, it's more danceable...).___"
